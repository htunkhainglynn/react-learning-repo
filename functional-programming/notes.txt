More like function in mathematic rather than programming functions. 

Rules:
	1) Always takes an input  [func(func)]
	2) Always gives an output 
	3) There is one just one output for the same input 
    
    for example :
		
		// this is pure function
		function next(counter)
		{
		    return counter + 1;
		}
		It doesn't rely on the outer state. So it is easy to understand once it is looked.
		For 1 it outputs 2;
		For 2 it outputs 3;
		Whenever 1 comes back again it will output 2 always.
		**For an input X gives a single output Y**
		
		// This is the example of impure function
		
		let counter;
		
		function getCounter() 
		{
		    return counter ++;
		}
		If counter variable was changed getCounter will return different output every time it was called.
