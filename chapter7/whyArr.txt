arr = [10, 20, 30]; => reference => 0x10

so...

10 locates in 0x10 on memory and index [0]
20 locates in 0x14 on memory and index [1]
30 locates in 0x18 on memory and index [2]

get location (forget 0x)

formula -> arr + (index * size)

for index 0, 10 + (0 * 4) = 10 => 0x10
for index 1, 10 + (1 * 4) = 14 => 0x14
for index 2, 10 + (2 * 4) = 18 => 0x18

if index starts from 1

formula -> arr + ((index - 1) * size) => need to do one more step
